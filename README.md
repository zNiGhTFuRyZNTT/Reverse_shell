# Intelligent Reverse Shell Client

## Introduction
 - This program is the client side of Reverse shell attack, It was created as a fun project but things get intresting when you can gain access to anybody's Windows command line without being concerned about the FIREWALL xD.
 - Because the Information are being transfered through Websocket, Firewall can do nothing to stop it on the client's system.
 - and Also about the security, By using this you don't need to do port forwarding and other unsafe stuff, so your security is more GURANTEED.
 - the only problem is the speed, the speed may be a little low and that depends on which tunneling service you are using, for now we use ngrok.

## DESCRIPTION
 - If you are the hacker you have to listen for the connection using websocat(included in project for both linux and Windows) and expose it to the internet with ngrok.
 - and then you have to paste the wss address to the main.py -> (the client file) and compile it to exe

---
## How to use
 * Assuming you already have enough knowledge about python, pyinstaller and websockets.

    First of all install the Requirements :
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    <br>then we have to first setup the listener, It is recomented to listen on a linux machine but Windows is also alright
    as you can see in `Listeners` Directory we have <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat">Websocat</a><br>
     both for windows and linux, If you faced any error try downloading the last version

     based on your OS run:
    ```
    websocat -s xxxx
    ```
    where xxxx is the port you want to listen on so replace it with a port number like
    ```
    websocat -s 5050
    ```
    <br>
    Now we have to expose port 5050 to the internt so we can make it accessible for the target so we can access the target Windoes machine.
    <br>
    Doanload <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a>.<br><br>
    After downloading ngrok:<br>
    on windows : Move it to a folder so you can run it by opening a cmd in that directory<br>
    on Linux: Also do the same thing as windows except you also have to give execute permition to it by running:<br>
    
    ```
    chmod +x ngrok
    ```
    Then run it:
    ```
    ./ngrok http 5050
    ```
    (!) Note : make sure the port you are using for both websocat and ngrok are the same.<br>
    After Running that you will see something like this:<br>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./Images/ngrok.png" alt="ngrok"/></p>
    Just Copy the link as underlined in the screen shot and paste it in `address = ""` variable in main.py
    <br><br>

    Now that we have set up our liteners we need to compile the main.py to exe.
    <bt>
    run:

    
    -   ```
        pip install pyinstaller
        ```
    - ```
      pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
        ```
    
        - Now You'll find the executable in dist and we will gain access to the windows machine who runs this executable
         - you can rename it to whatever you want and even change the icon to make it more realistic.
